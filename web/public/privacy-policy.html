    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: September 24, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Piano8283 Studio ("we", "our", or "us") operates the DangunLand MUD Client application. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our MUD client application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our MUD client is designed to connect you to Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game servers. We collect minimal information necessary for the application to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Connection Data:</strong> Server addresses and port numbers you configure to connect to MUD servers</li>
        <li><strong>Application Settings:</strong> User preferences, macros, and display settings stored locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Basic diagnostic information to ensure the application functions properly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable connections to MUD game servers</li>
        <li>Save your application preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Provide technical support when needed</li>
        <li>Improve the application's functionality and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your settings and preferences are stored locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> We do not store your personal data on our servers</li>
        <li><strong>Game Server Communication:</strong> Communications with MUD servers are direct connections; we do not intercept or store game data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our application connects to third-party MUD game servers. The privacy practices of these servers are governed by their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. We may share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your explicit consent</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations</li>
        <li>To protect our rights and safety</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our application is not specifically designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since most data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can modify or delete your settings at any time through the application</li>
        <li>You can uninstall the application to remove all locally stored data</li>
        <li>You can contact us with questions about your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
