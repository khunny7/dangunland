OVERVIEW
Piano8283 Studio ("we", "our", or "us") operates the DangunLand MUD Client application. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our MUD client application.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Our MUD client is designed to connect you to Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game servers. We collect minimal information necessary for the application to function:
- Connection Data: Server addresses and port numbers you configure to connect to MUD servers
- Application Settings: User preferences, macros, and display settings stored locally on your device  
- Technical Data: Basic diagnostic information to ensure the application functions properly

HOW WE USE INFORMATION
The information we collect is used solely to:
- Enable connections to MUD game servers
- Save your application preferences and settings
- Provide technical support when needed
- Improve the application's functionality and user experience

DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY
- Local Storage: Your settings and preferences are stored locally on your device
- No Cloud Storage: We do not store your personal data on our servers
- Game Server Communication: Communications with MUD servers are direct connections; we do not intercept or store game data

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
Our application connects to third-party MUD game servers. The privacy practices of these servers are governed by their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

DATA SHARING
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. We may share information only in the following circumstances:
- With your explicit consent
- To comply with legal obligations  
- To protect our rights and safety

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our application is not specifically designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

YOUR RIGHTS
Since most data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your information:
- You can modify or delete your settings at any time through the application
- You can uninstall the application to remove all locally stored data
- You can contact us with questions about your data
